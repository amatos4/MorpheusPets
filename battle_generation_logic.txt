sum_p = sum of player's party's levels
sum_o = sum of opponent's party's levels

exp_mod = sqrt(sum_o / sum_p) [rounded to one decimal place, capped at 5]

Experience gain for win: 20 * exp_mod
Experience gain for loss: 10 * exp_mod 

Exp gain should always be an integer (no decimal).
The maximum possible amount of EXP earned in battle is 100

Leveling:
	A pet will level up for every 100 exp it receives.
	The maximum level for a pet is 100.	
	
Battle:
	
	Phys. Attack:
		On success, deals
			rand(level + 1, (level + (brawn div 4) + (speed div 8))) 
		damage
		
		On draw, deals
			(successful_damage div 2)
		damage
		
	Mag. Attack:
		On success, deals
			rand(level + 1, (level + (focus div 4) + (speed div 8)))
		damage
			
		On draw, deals
			(successful_damage div 2)
		damage
		
	Block:
		On success, deals
			rand(level + 1, (level + (guts div 4) + (speed div 8))) div 2
		damage
		
		On draw, deals no damage
		
	Damage Reduction applies any time a pet would take damage:
		rand((level div 10), ((level div 10) + (brawn div 10) + (speed div 20))
	
	Max HP:
		20 + level + (essence div 3) + ((brawn + guts + focus + speed + grit) div 10)
		
AI:
	If a pet has less than 10% health remaining:
		If there is a bet without any damage:
			Switch pet
	
	Otherwise:
		switch(rand(1, 5))
			case 1:
				Use physical attack
			case 2:
				Use magic attack
			case 3:
				Use block
			case 4:
				Counter the player's best pick
			case 5:
				Use your best pick
				
	Determining best picks:
		if (brawn > focus && brawn > grit)
			Phys Attack
		else if (focus > grit)
			Mag. Attack
		else
			Block
